    "You walk into a tiny store. You try to turn around and you are ambushed by products, a cheesy tutu falls to the ground. You are immediately greeted by the owner and pointe shoe fitter who has a lot of… personality. You sit down and wait for your fitting for thirty minutes. If this is you right now, there is really only one place you could be: Dancer’s Image. There are so many products in that small store near downtown Newton, Massachusetts that they have forgotten to give customers with services they want and people they can make a connection to. This is why if you are planning to go to Dancer’s Image, you are wasting your time and your valuable money.

When you walk into Dancer’s Image, your senses are overloaded with sights, smells, and even tastes. The store is just too crowded and the space is shaped like a bottle; skinny at the entrance and fat at the back. All of their stock is on pallets in the back of the store like a warehouse. Since the store looks like a Costco but in a standard New York apartment, the layout of Dancer’s Image takes away a certain class that should be in a dance store, and as a customer, this was disconcerting.  

Pointe shoe fittings are annoying; having to try on many sizes and styles of shoes. But fittings at Dancer’s Image are more than just slightly enraging. Since they take two to three hours, afterwards you feel like you need a massage. The fitter is very talkative and she can and will talk for at least half of the fitting, contributing to the overall length of it. And, for all this, the fitter doesn’t even give you her full attention as they schedule multiple fittings at once, making her fittings less accurate than their already low standard.

At the head of this clearly sinking ship is the owner and pointe shoe “fitter” Paula Panos. The fitter is rude, brash, and disrespectful of her customers. She is clearly more of a saleswoman than a shoe fitter. She has never worn pointe shoes in her life, and that is made very clear as she consistently fits shoes incorrectly and when more knowledgeable people come around and disagree with her, she tells you to “stick up for yourself”. Sometimes it seems as if the fitter cares more about her reputation than the safety of her clients. This being said, the other staff at Dancer’s Image are incredibly helpful, but even that bunch of twenty-something year olds could do a better fitting than Paula Panos. 

In your “short” visit to Dancer’s Image, whether it’s for pointe shoes or a cheesy tutu, you will find new ways to be pressured to buy things you didn’t even know existed. While it’s not all bad, it is an awful shopping experience which shows why they can’t expand. If you are planning to go to Dancer’s Image, then you should quickly change your plans!Dancer’s Image: A Pointe-less Waste of Money
