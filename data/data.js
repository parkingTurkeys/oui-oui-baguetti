    `Middle and high schoolers are almost always groggy in the morning. There is a reason for that: early school start times. Both “The Teen Who Woke Up Her School” by Jane Bianchi and “Why Schools Are Struggling to Let Students Sleep In” by Alexandra Sifferlin believe that schools should start later. Around the country, there is a raging debate going on about if schools should start later. Some schools have decided to start school later, but for those who’s schools have not, it is an unfortunate morning for them. Middle and high schools should start later so that students can learn better, have better mental health, and be more popular with students, teachers, and parents. <br><br>

One reason for this is that later start times for schools would make it easier to learn. One Jane Bianchi said when talking about groggy school students, “After a good night's rest, you're more alert and it's easier to solve problems, process and remember information, and be creative.” This demonstrates that students who can get more sleep at night can solve problems and therefore learn more easily and get better grades. Another author named Alexandra Sifferlin said also when talking about lethargic students, “Among adolescents, getting the recommended amount of sleep (around nine hours) has been linked to higher test scores and better behavior.” From this, one can conclude that schools with earlier start times do worse on major tests such as the MCAS, the CAASPP, and the NYSA. <br><br>

Another reason is that later start times for schools would improve the mental health of students. When discussing the mental health of students, Ms. Jane Bianchi says “A growing body of research over the past two decades has shown… That the amount of sleep you get (just like what you eat and how much you exercise) can have a profound effect on your overall physical and mental health.” One might think from this that having later school start times means that students will have better mental and physical health, just like other factors. So since students with later start times get more sleep due to the circadian rhythms, they have better health and can learn better. When talking about how school start times and how her child does her homework better with more sleep, parent Elizabeth Ende tells Alexandra Sifferlin,“‘Now she gets through homework more quickly, and when she’s working, she looks more alert.’” This could tell someone that students with a later school start time can have better health and therefore will be able to be more accurate in their work and they will be able to finish it faster and have time for living their life.<br><br>

Lastly, later school start times are more popular with students, teachers, and parents. When telling the story of a student who was able to move the start time of her school back a full half hour, Jane Bianchi says “So when her school board proposed switching her Columbia, Missouri, high school’s start time from 7:50 a.m. to 7:20 a.m.– a full half hour earlier – she was outraged. ‘ I thought it was the worst idea I'd ever heard,’ she says.” Early school start times are clearly unpopular with students. Some even started movements due to their rage towards this. According to the Sleep Foundation, only 36.6% of students, teachers, and parents think that schools start at the right time currently. When talking about early school start times, the AAA foundation surveyed 100 middle school and high schools, one of each from each state, and they found that only 18 out of 100 schools start at or after the CDC recommended time of 8:30 AM. This study also found that on average, Massachusetts has the second earliest start times for high schools, just eight minutes after Louisiana. School times are clearly unliked, even by the US Government and specifically, the CDC! That government department says that middle and high schools should start at 8:30 AM for the health of students and faculty. Despite this, 80% of schools start earlier than 8:30, and schools and parents can really see the difference.<br><br>

Some schools claim that this plan would be too much work and that it would be too expensive, one Jodi McClay says, "We wanted to change, but ultimately, we couldn’t.” Others say that moving up start times would cost too much, some initiatives costing over eight million dollars. “Is this the best way to spend taxpayer dollars?” said Judith Keeler. Although this plan is costly, isn’t it worthwhile for students to be healthy and attentive in class? Shouldn’t schools be focused on the needs of their students and aren't students learning and striving for their full learning potential what schools are here for?<br><br>

Schools should have later start times because later start times in middle and high school make it easier for students to learn and get higher grades, improve the mental health of students, and be more popular with students, faculty, and parents. Having late start times is very important for students and schools should really start to realize that.<br> <br>
