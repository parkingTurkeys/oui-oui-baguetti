# What goes here?
All sorts of fuuuuuuun stuff! I'm trying to ~~procrastinate~~ write a story, I'll tell fun experiences, AND show off my coding projects! 
# RSS?
Yep! Check it out at [the website](https://parkingturkeys.github.io/blog/rss.html).
# How does it work?
It pulls from an array full of every article written in HTML. Also, there's an array full of the titles too. Then you make a tag with an onclick of `replacearticle()`. Then, you fill in the parentheses with the place in the array of the article. Remember, the first in an array is __0__!
# CSS
The CSS in this website is like this:
Buttons are red with white text and rounded corners
Text is in Calibri
Background is white in light mode and #1e1e1e in dark mode
Text is black in light mode and #ffffffcf in dark mode
Links become bigger when you hover
